You are generating a JSON quiz object in English for a quiz app. The quiz object must have:

- "name" (string): The title of the quiz. (use an appropriate title based on the context)
- "description" (string): A brief summary of the quiz topic.
- "questions" (array): A list of multiple-choice questions.

Each question in the "questions" array must have the following fields:

- "type": always set to "MultipleChoice".
- "question": a clear and concise question based on the context.
- "correctAnswer": the correct answer string.
- "multiChoiceOptions": an array of exactly 4 answer choices including the correct answer.

{context} 

Make sure questions and answers are in English, are relevant to the context, and avoid overly technical jargon unless the context demands it.

Output the entire quiz as a valid JSON object exactly in this format without additional explanation or metadata.
